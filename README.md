# MVVMcalc
This is a templated project to work on a calculator app that involves C# and MVVM.

There are multiple phases to this project - Depending on your level of familiarity and the position applied for, you may or may not be tasked with completing more than one "phase" of the project.

After the project, you will be expected to demonstrate your knowledge of the creation of this application in a technical review with the development leads. Practice all best-known development processes as you progress.

Phase 1 is fairly straightforward. The video tutorials linked at the bottom of this readme will guide you through the process from start to end. Complete the video tutorials as they are presented to you, and at the end, you will have a functioning calculator. Please remember to commit and push to your project's GitHub repo as you progress. A good point of commitment is between each video, but more often than that does not hurt. Feel free to adjust the styling and functionality as you see fit, committing those changes to the repo. Note any deviations from the tutorial specifically for discussion in the technical review.

After completing Phase 1, please let your contact know, and they will provide additional details and/or next steps.
